<h1>The Best Movies According to Noah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of All-Time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The concept is really interesting and unique. The visuals reinforce the idea of the film's uniqueness</p>

<h3> Manchester By the Sea</h3>
<p>This movie was very sad, and had similarly themed music and visuals. Very effective in it's pacing.</p>

<h3>Nausicaa</h3>
<p>Even though this movie was similar to Princess Mononoke, I thought that the visuals were so cool for the 70s, and was a clear inspiration for the movies which came afterwards.</p>
